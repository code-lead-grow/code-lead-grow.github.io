**We provide custom training services for <span class="font__highlight">individuals</span>** who need a personal trainer/coach/mentor. Our goal is to make you excellent at building software solutions.

### Criteria for acceptance

* You've been a developer for a **solid** 6 months or longer.
* You're comfortable writing in JavaScript.

### Length of training

* You pay, we teach. It's up to you how long you need us.

### Current training offerings

**<span class="font__highlight">We're currently training on front-end development using JavaScript.</span>**

This is a pilot program (we're a startup) and there are still things to work out. Since we value flexibility, we expect the length to be as you need.

### "I'm interested, where do I start?"

**Contact us. We'll have tea/coffee and chat about what training could look like for you.**
