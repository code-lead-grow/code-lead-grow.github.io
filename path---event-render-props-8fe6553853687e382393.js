Often, we don’t think about the design complexities when writing component APIs, do we? When another developer struggles to use your component because there’s a spider\'s web of prop dependencies you will wonder if there’s a better way.</p>\n<p>“It’s OK, just add a prop called <code>x</code> …”. Most times, we just add another prop to make the issues go away. Yet, the whole reason your component is hard to use is because there are too many props. You need a cleaner API.</p>\n<p><em>In this session we are going to do some coding</em> and add render props to a naughty React component.</p>\n<h3>What to bring</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b><span class="font__highlight">Rs.200</span></b> entry fee</li>\n<li>Laptop (optional) for following the exercise and/or coding after the event</li>\n<li>Notepad + pen (optional)</li>\n<li>Eyeglasses 🤓   if you have trouble reading projectors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How much experience do I need?</h3>\n<p>We\'ve marked this workshop as <b><span class="font__highlight">intermediate</span></b> for React.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You should feel comfortable using React in day-to-day work</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>In which language is the talk given?</h3>\n<p>English. However, there will be a Nepali-speaking coordinator at the event to make any clarifications.</p>\n<h3>What is the format?</h3>\n<p>We will be holding an interactive talk, where questions are welcomed during the presentation. Feel free to bring your own laptop and join along with the lesson.</p>\n<h3>Will the workshop be recorded?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Participants will be given a link to the recording via Slack, email, or SMS, sometime after the workshop.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Easy-to-use React component APIs with render props",date:"June 16, 2018",time:"2:00PM",path:"/event/render-props",tags:["react","workshop","event","javascript"],excerpt:"2:00PM.
