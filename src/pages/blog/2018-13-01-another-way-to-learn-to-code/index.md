**Hi üëãüèº, I'm Jeremiah. I'm a developer who wants to help other developers get to bigger places in their skillset and career.**

I started Code Lead Grow as a way to better serve committed developers in Nepal.


## Where are we now?

Me and a few other people are looking to take tech education in Kathmandu to the next level.

We feel there's a lot going on in this region of the world, but Nepal has been overlooked as a world resource **for
new, exciting, world-changing products.** Nepal (especially Kathmandu) is uniquely positioned to start solving many of the world's development issues, while also competing in other verticals startups around the world have begun to disrupt.

Here are three tech areas I think Nepal will excel in. These are areas of expertise Nepal can benefit from, today.

1. AI
2. Blockchain (not crypto because it's banned, for now)
3. Localised, performant, highly-available apps for government and society

Nepal's progress in experiementing with these areas, like AI, is coming along. There's been a surge of interest in the international program *AI Saturdays* implemented by [AIDevNepal](http://aidevnepal.org/). Yet, despite all the buzz, it's been difficult to keep great talent in the country. With open access to India, why don't more developers go learn tech skills at conferences and classes? I think it's a matter of cost. I went to Bangalore this past year for a 3-day conference and it was expensive! Our holiday time isn't much and we want to be with friends and family when we're taking a break.

## What's a solution?

In our industry, one thing which shows no signs of stopping soon are tech conferences. While they may have a bad reputation from some, they are an undeniable "safe space" where new skills can be learned, strong connections are made, and careers boosted.

Exciting conferences are an area where we want to make a strong impact in Nepal, starting in Kathmandu. There's no reason an international tech conference can't
happen here in the relative comfort of our city.

Many will cite fears of cost for the event and attendees, but what are we afraid of? We already spend so much on rent, motor vehicles, food, clothes and significant others that it's time we *invest* a bit of our money into real, transferable skills. After all, these skills pay the bills.

What's stopping us? The issue I see in Kathmandu is this: everyone thinks the time and cost isn't worth the effort. I strongly disagree. We need to jumpstart international tech events in Kathmandu, and soon. Developer happiness inside Nepal will skyrocket if we start with small developer-centric solutions and keep the effort pumping. Plus, everyone loves conferences, even the introverts (me).

One day I saw an advert for a marketing conference in Nepal and the fee was a jaw-dropping Rs.15,000 for *early-bird* (I'm nearly positive). I know we can do better than this, and have *real, impactful content and speakers* to boot. Tech people are known for their clever problem-solving. We're ready to start solving this one.

With enough small conferences per year, we can start to fuel tech growth and stoke excitement and investment into Nepal. Foolhardy? Maybe, but I'm willing to try it, anyway.

I'll leave it there, for now ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Sincerely,

Jeremiah Trein
