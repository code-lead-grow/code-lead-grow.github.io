### Overview
Component APIs can get messy in React. Often, we don&rsquo;t think about the design complexities when writing component APIs, do we? When another developer struggles to use your component because there&rsquo;s a spider's web of prop dependencies you will wonder if there&rsquo;s a better way.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK, just add a prop called `x` &hellip;&rdquo;. Most times, we just add another prop to make the issues go away. Yet, the whole reason your component is hard to use is because there are too many props. You need a cleaner API.

*In this session we are going to do some coding* and add render props to a naughty React component.
